# Computer-Vision
This project is an immersive game of Rock-Paper-Scissors between the computer and the player that uses python's Open-Cv library to capture images of the player's chosen move  after a specified timer. Points are then awarded to the winner of each round until the limit is reached and the victor is announced before the game terminates. 
There's always the option to play again if the desired. 
Teachable Machines was used to train and test our models(player's accepted and expected moves) which were then used together with the OPen-Cv library for the running of our application.
